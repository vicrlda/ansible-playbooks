    The core culture of Brazil is derived from Portuguese culture,
    because of its strong colonial ties with the Portuguese Empire.
    Among other influences, the Portuguese introduced
    the Portuguese language, Roman Catholicism and colonial architectural styles.
    The culture was, however, also strongly influenced by
    African, indigenous and non-Portuguese European cultures and traditions.

    Since 1788, the primary influence behind Australian culture has been Anglo-Celtic Western culture,
    with some Indigenous influences.
    The divergence and evolution that has occurred in the ensuing centuries has resulted in a distinctive Australian culture.
    Since the mid-20th century,
    American popular culture has strongly influenced Australia,
    particularly through television and cinema.
    Other cultural influences come from neighbouring Asian countries,
    and through large-scale immigration from non-English-speaking nations.
